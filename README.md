# Data Decoded: Harnessing Python's PANDAS Library

## Welcome to Experiment 3!
Python Data Analysis (PANDAS), a project showcases fundamental data analysis skills utillizing Python's PANDAS library. The repository includes codes and solutions for data manipulation and analysis, guiding users through important concept like loading, visualizing, and exploring data.

### Little Overview before we start
This experiment explores the use of pandas for efficient data analysis. By loading a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame, we will go through a set of problems designed to help you become familiar with basic operations.

#### I. Intended Learning Outcome
1. To identify the codes and functions incorportaed in the Pandas library
2. To be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program using a Pandas library.

#### II. Instructions
Write a Python script/code in the Jupyter Notebook to do the given problem. You may submit your Jupyter notebook in the dedicated submission bin.

For this programming assignment, download the following file and save to your default user folder: https://bit.ly/Cars_file

##### Problem Overview
#### Problem 1: Exploring the Cars Dataset
        We will be working with a dataset in .csv format and performing the following tasks:
         a. Step 1: Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame names c a r s.
         b. Display the first five and last five rows of the DataFrame to inspect the structure and content of the dataset.

         The dataset represents real-world data related to cars, and this simple analysis will help us gain familiarity with loading and exploring the data using pandas.
