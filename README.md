# Data Decoded: Harnessing Python's PANDAS Library

## Welcome to Experiment 3!
Python Data Analysis (PANDAS), a project showcases fundamental data analysis skills utillizing Python's PANDAS library. The repository includes codes and solutions for data manipulation and analysis, guiding users through important concept like loading, visualizing, and exploring data.

### Little Overview before we start
#### This experiment explores the use of pandas for efficient data analysis. By loading a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame, we will go through a set of problems designed to help you become familiar with basic operations.
