# Data Decoded: Harnessing Python's PANDAS Library

## Welcome to Experiment 3!
Python Data Analysis (PANDAS), a project showcases fundamental data analysis skills utillizing Python's PANDAS library. The repository includes codes and solutions for data manipulation and analysis, guiding users through important concept like loading, visualizing, and exploring data.

### Little Overview before we start
This experiment explores the use of pandas for efficient data analysis. By loading a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame, we will go through a set of problems designed to help you become familiar with basic operations.

#### I. Intended Learning Outcome
1. To identify the codes and functions incorportaed in the Pandas library
2. To be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program using a Pandas library.

#### II. Instructions
Write a Python script/code in the Jupyter Notebook to do the given problem. You may submit your Jupyter notebook in the dedicated submission bin.
